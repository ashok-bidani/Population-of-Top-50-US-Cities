## US Urban Areas and Agricultural Productivity
Following along with the book, "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web", I produced a choropleth web map of the US. States are coded according to agricultural productivity where more intense color = higher productivity. The largest 50 cities are overlaid on top of the map as yellow bubbles. D3 V5 was used for producing the map.
